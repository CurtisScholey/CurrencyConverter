# CurrencyConverter
Currency converter app for Software Engineering Summative 1

## Introduction
My workplace is an international business and as such often requires the conversion of currency. To this end, I will begin the creation of an online currency converter internal to the company.
This will enable our business & finance departments to convert currency quickly and efficienctly, without the worry of using publically available tools - As preventing any potential data collection on company finances is a key security consideration.

## Scope
The tool must meet the following functional and nonfunctional requirements to be considered an MVP, with each to be tested when fitting to ensure the all requirements are met.

### Functional Requirements
- Currency Conversion
    - The tool must allow the user to select two currencies to convert between.
    - The resulting value should be displayed and be correct as per the conversion rate.
- User Interface
    - The tool must have a functional and easy to navigate interface.
    - This interface must be tested to ensure accessability.
- Currency Options
    - The tool must clearly list all avaliable conversions
    - The available options will at minimum include currencies of which the organisation is most active (Euro, Great British Pound, United States Dollar & Japenese Yen).
- Error Handling
    - The tool handles errors in a user friendly manner, providing relevant error messages.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Reliablilty
    - The tool must work reliably and consistently, for both currency conversion and ensuring uptime.
- Usability
    - The tool must be easy to navigate for users of all technical ability.
    - The tool should be accessible on varying devices (Mobile, PC etc).
- Maintainablity
    - The code will be well documented to enable future edits.
- Scalability
    - The system should be created to enable updates to scale, such as to add more conversion rates or enable multiple simultaionous conversions.
